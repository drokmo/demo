Drokmo recognizes both the absence pertinence of research and information on issues of sexual and reproductive health and rights, and sexual and gender based violence in the Tibetan exile community. We also believe that evidence-based work is key to ensuring that we fulfill the needs of the community. Hence, filling in the huge gaps in information is a priority for us.
In 2018, we conducted baseline surveys to assess the knowledge, perceptions, practices and status of menstrual health management and sexual- and gender-based violence with 489 students of STS Miao, Tezu, Tenzingang and Sonada, and CTS Darjeeling and Kalimpong. 
In 2019, as part of education on Responsible Menstrual Health Management, Drokmo is conducting a pilot program of introducing washable cloth pads to 70 girls in 2 schools, through which we will assess the feasibility of introducing washable cloth pads as safer, more environmentally-friendly alternatives to disposable pads in schools. This will allow us to either expand the program, or explore other methods to reduce waste produced through the disposal of sanitary pads. Part of the program will also be to explore and work on disposal mechanisms depending on the location of the different schools.
