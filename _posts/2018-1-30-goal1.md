In 2018, we began our work on Comprehensive Sexuality Health Education by developing a unique curriculum for Responsible Menstrual Health Management and Introduction to Gender and Violence for children of ages 10 and above studying in Tibetan schools around the Indian subcontinent. We spoke on these topics with 489 boys and girls of grades 6-12 in 4 Sambhota Tibetan Schools (STS) in Tezu, Miao, Tenzingang and Sonada, and 2 Central Tibetan Schools (CTS) in Darjeeling and Kalimpong.
Under this program, we have also distributed Menstrupedia comic books to these schools. Menstrupedia is a colorful, fun and accessible guide to menstruation for young boys and girls.
